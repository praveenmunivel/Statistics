The Bootstrap:

Bootstrap sample
A sample taken with replacement from an observed data set.

Resampling
The process of taking repeated samples from observed data; includes both bootstrap and permutation (shuffling) procedures.

Conceptually, you can imagine the bootstrap as replicating the original sample thousands or millions of times so that you have a hypothetical population that embodies all the knowledge from your original sample (it’s just larger)

We simply replace each observation after each draw; that is, we sample with replacement. In this way we effectively create an infinite population in which the probability of an element being drawn remains unchanged from draw to draw. The algorithm for a bootstrap resampling of the mean, for a sample of size n, is as follows:

1.Draw a sample value, record it, and then replace it.

2.Repeat n times.

3.Record the mean of the n resampled values.

4.Repeat steps 1–3 R times.

5.Use the R results to:

6.Calculate their standard deviation (this estimates sample mean standard error).

7.Produce a histogram or boxplot.

8.Find a confidence interval.


PYTHON CODE:

results = []
for nrepeat in range(1000):
    sample = resample(data)
    results.append(sample.median())
results = pd.Series(results)
print('Bootstrap Statistics:')
print(f'original: {data.median()}')
print(f'bias: {results.mean() - data.median()}')
print(f'std. error: {results.std()}')
